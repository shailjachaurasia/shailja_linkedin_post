12 Must-Know GenAI Terms for Everyone in Tech

Here's a simple breakdown of the essential terms you need to understand today's generative AI landscape.

Foundation Models

𝗟𝗟𝗠 (𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹) 
These are the massive AI systems trained on enormous text datasets that power tools like ChatGPT and Claude. They understand and generate human-like text, serving as the foundation for modern AI conversations and content creation.

𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 
The revolutionary architecture behind modern AI systems. Transformers process text in a way that captures relationships between words across long distances, enabling breakthrough capabilities in language understanding.

Input & Processing Concepts

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 
The art of crafting effective instructions for AI systems. Good prompt engineering combines clear instructions, relevant context, and helpful constraints to get the best possible outputs from AI models.

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗼𝘄 
How much text an AI can "remember" during a conversation. Larger context windows (measured in tokens) allow AI to reference more information when generating responses.

𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝘀 
The basic units AI models use to process text. These can be words, parts of words, or characters. When you use AI systems, your text is broken into these pieces for processing.

Model Enhancement Techniques

𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗲-𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 
Customizing general AI models for specific tasks by training them on specialized datasets. This makes them perform better for particular applications or industries.

𝗥𝗔𝗚 (𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝘂𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻) 
Combining AI text generation with the ability to look up information from external sources. This helps models provide more accurate, up-to-date responses.

𝗭𝗲𝗿𝗼-𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘁 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 
An AI's ability to perform tasks it wasn't specifically trained for by applying its general knowledge. This lets models handle new situations they haven't explicitly seen before.

Technical Parameters & Challenges

𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 
The way AI represents words, phrases, or concepts as numbers in multidimensional space. This mathematical representation enables AI to understand meaning and find relationships between ideas.

𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 
A setting that controls how random or creative AI outputs will be. Lower temperature means more predictable responses; higher temperature produces more varied and creative outputs.

𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻-𝗼𝗳-𝗧𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁 
A technique that encourages AI to show its work by breaking down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning. This improves accuracy and makes AI decision-making more transparent.

𝗛𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 
When AI confidently generates information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect. Managing hallucinations remains one of the biggest challenges in deploying reliable AI systems.

Understanding these key terms will help you navigate AI discussions!


Not all AI agents are created equal — and the framework you choose shapes your system's intelligence, adaptability, and real-world value.

As we transition from monolithic LLM apps to 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀, developers and organizations are seeking frameworks that can support 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, and 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.
